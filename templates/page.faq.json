This construction makes engineered hardwood less expensive to buy and more sustainable to produce. It’s also more stable and harder-wearing than solid wood.<\/p><p>Laminate wood floors are composed of layers that aren’t wood, but are manufactured to look like wood. The top wear layer is made of hard-wearing materials, making laminate floors a long-lasting choice.<\/p>"}},"a6f9ff91-94a7-4480-8883-e0d05e0d9f95":{"type":"faq_right","settings":{"title":"Can I sand and stain engineered hardwood?","content":"<p>You can sand or stain certain types of engineered hardwood to give it new life.<\/p><p>But, while you can refinish solid wood floors a number of times, engineered hardwood can only be refinished if it has a “wear layer” of 6mm or deeper.

That means that you’ll be sanding and staining a layer of the product that is natural wood, without going deeper into the other layers.<\/p><p>You won’t be able to refinish engineered hardwood as often as natural wood, but you can still give it a facelift a few times in its lifespan.<\/p>"}},"1cd2cdbe-cd3f-4a3c-8221-352e00aa82ef":{"type":"faq_right","settings":{"title":"Can you have underfloor heating with wood floors?","content":"<p>Underfloor heating works brilliantly with engineered hardwood and laminate wood floors.
